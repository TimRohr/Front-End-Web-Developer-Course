* I have learned how to use Atom for editing html files. I have also used VIM in the past, but find that atom is a more user friendly application. I have also learned how to look up html syntax to implement into my code when I am not familiar with the syntax. 
* I have done some HTML in the past so learning on the newer html is coming a little bit easier for me. 
* Finding the right syntax can be a challenge due to differences in older and new HTML.  
* I have used atom to catch typo's in my syntax while writting my code. I have also used online resources to find the correct syntax for displaying the element.
